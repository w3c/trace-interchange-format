# Distributed Tracing Working Group

This repository is being used for work in the [W3C Distributed Trace Context
Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2018/distributed-tracing/).

Contributions to this repository are intended to become part of Recommendation-track documents governed by the
[W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/) and
[Software and Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software). To make substantive contributions to specifications, you must either participate
in the relevant W3C Working Group or make a non-member patent licensing commitment.

If you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all
contributors in the pull request comment.

To add a contributor (other than yourself, that's automatic), mark them one per line as follows:

```
+@github_username
```

If you added a contributor by mistake, you can remove them in a comment with:

```
-@github_username
```

If you are making a pull request on behalf of someone else but you had no part in designing the
feature, you can remove yourself with the above syntax.

## Editing report

This repository follows the best practices from https://w3c.github.io/

- Report is generated by [ReSpec](https://github.com/w3c/respec/wiki).
- We highly encourage to use line breaks in markdown files at 80 characters
  wide. There are tools that can do it for you effectively. Please submit
  proposal to include your editor settings required to enable this behavior so
  the out of the box settings for this repository will be consistent.
- To view report locally - start the local server like `python -m
  SimpleHTTPServer` to avoid cross-site file loading issue
- You can preview report from your branch or fork
  `http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/<organization>/trace-interchange-format/blob/<branchname>/index.html`.
  It is useful to review PR suggestions.
